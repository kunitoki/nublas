Schema isn't ideal for my use case.

This project encourages:

 *many* `contacts` attached to `companies`.

My need is:

 *many* `companies` (nominal `contacts`, but still excellent searchability)
 *many* notes

also: need to extend to facilitate `campaigns` of some kind.

Love the UI, but far enough off the mark (also not using standard django patterns) that effort probably better spent on my use case.
